        <p>At the beginning of 2013 I started learning about elasticsearch. I was looking at existing plugins for
            elasticsearch with basic functionality to learn about the data in the elasticsearch index. I did not really
            find what I was looking for. Therefore I started writing my own plugin. The goal for this project is to
            learn about the capabilities of elasticsearch and learn about some other frameworks along the way. These
            frameworks are described on the right side of this page.</p>

        <p>By now the plugins is becoming usable. There are means to experiment with a search engine. You can look
            at the effects of some options to the executed query. You can even look at some graphs.</p>

        <p>In the nearby future I am planning on creating more features related to facets, filters and other more
            advanced stuff.</p>

        <p>You can install this plugin in your own elasticsearch instance, but you can also use a deployed version
            on my website. I do my best to keep it up to date.</p>

                <p>AngularJS is the MVC framework for the client. The nice thing about using angularjs for an
                    elasticsearch
                    plugin is that you can create a static site plugin. Still using angularjs you can create a very rich
                    client side application.</p>

                <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/#">website</a>

                <p>Twitter bootstrap is started as a pure css/html library to enable developers to create nice looking
                    websites without to much effort. Nowadays a lot of (javascript) components are available that make
                    life
                    even easier.</p>
